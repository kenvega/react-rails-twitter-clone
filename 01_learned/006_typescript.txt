for react setter hook functions that you pass as props to child components

  when declaring them with typescript they should always have a type similar to this:

    (value: string) => void;

    because the setter hook function does not return anything

    also it doesn't have to be 'value'. this is just a placeholder to give more context but it is necessary to indicate a parameter
