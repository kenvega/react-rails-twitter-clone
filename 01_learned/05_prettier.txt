even if your project have root folders as rails and has a client folder for the react part

  you can create a .prettierrc file in the root of your project with rails and react

    and the react part at least in vscode with the prettier extension should read that .prettierrc file and use the rules from that

      for example i used this rule at the start

        {
          "printWidth": 120
        }

      i made sure that in vscode i had this inside my settings.json file

        "[typescriptreact]": {
          "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
        },

      and with that when formatting files i get my react components formatted with a maximum of 120 characters before making a new line

you should still have installed prettier as a dev dependency in your project. why?

  with that you could have a pre-commit set up in the project to make sure files are formatted in every commit

  the prettier vscode extension can use your project installed version of your project even if it is not at the root of your project

    you would need to add this config to your .vscode/settings.json file

      {
        "prettier.prettierPath": "client/node_modules/prettier"
      }
