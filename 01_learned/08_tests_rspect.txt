to install the gem

    add "rspec-rails" to gemfile

      example

        group :development, :test do
          gem "bullet"
          ...
          gem "rspec-rails", "~> 6.0.0"
        end

    bundle install

    you have to run a command to install it

to run tests you run

  bundle exec rspec

to use helper methods from the devise gem and factory_bot gem in your rspec tests
  you have to make changes to spec/rails_helper.rb

  make sure to add these 2 configs
    RSpec.configure do |config|
      config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
      ...
      config.include Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers, type: :request
    end

    the line
      config.include Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers, type: :request

        will allow you to use methods in your rspec tests like
          sign_in
          sign_out
          current_user

    and the line
      config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods

        will allow you to use methods in your rspec tests like
          create # to create instances of a factory with the specified attributes
          build
