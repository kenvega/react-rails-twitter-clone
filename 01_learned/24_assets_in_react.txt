don't use relative paths for images. use absolute paths

  example

    client/src/components/TweetDetails.tsx

      this will fail in some routes (but not all. so is not recommended)
        <img src="./src/assets/chat.svg" alt="chat icon" className="w-4 mr-2" />

      what you have to do is this
        <img src="/src/assets/chat.svg" alt="chat icon" className="w-4 mr-2" />

      notice there is no relative path but an absolute path
        if you use relative paths those images might work sometimes
          but is not the ideal way to use them

      you could also do something like

        import LoadingIcon from "../assets/loading.svg?react";
        ...
        <LoadingIcon className="animate-spin w-3 h-3 ml-3" />

        so that you don't use <img /> but import it directly
