in root project just put this command

  npm create vite@latest

then select options
  i named my project: 'client'

once the scaffold is created

  cd client
  npm install
  npm run dev

install some dependencies in client folder

  npm install dotenv

create client/.env.development

  put something like this

    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4001/api/v1/tweets

change port

  in package.json you can just pass the port option

    "scripts": {
      "dev": "vite --port 4242",
      ...
    }

    then running npm run dev will run in port 4242

  another solution is to change it in client/vite.config.ts
