to run your created migrations (for db and test db)

  bundle exec rails db:migrate db:test:prepare

if you are in development and want to have your tables empty

  bundle exec rails db:drop db:create db:migrate # CAREFUL!!! will destroy all records of data in all tables

migrations done

  bundle exec rails g migration add_username_to_users username:string

  bundle exec rails g migration add_display_name_to_users display_name:string

  bundle exec rails g model like tweet:references user:references

  bundle exec rails g model Bookmark user:references tweet:references

    and add to the migration index unique for combination of references (a user can only bookmark the same tweet once)

  bundle exec rails g model retweet user:references tweet:references

  bundle exec rails g migration add_retweets_count_to_tweets retweets_count:integer

  bundle exec rails g migration add_parent_tweet_id_to_tweets tweet_id:bigint
    notice we add a tweet_id as bigint to be consistent with the tweet_id that is already in our tables (is bigint/int8 already)
