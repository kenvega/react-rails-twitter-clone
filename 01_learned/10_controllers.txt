when you have something like

  def index
    tweets = Tweet.all.includes(:user).order(created_at: :desc)

    render json: tweets
  end

this will not include the user info on every tweet in your response

this is because render json basically just runs .as_json internally on every tweet
  and .as_json will only serialize attributes of the tweet model
    and ignore any other attribute that is not specified explicitly

the user association is eagerly loaded but is not included by the .as_json
  so it won't be serialized in the json response


models are responsible for data and business logic

but serialization which is how we present the data is considered another separate layer
  models don't decide how data is serialized or presented in API responses
