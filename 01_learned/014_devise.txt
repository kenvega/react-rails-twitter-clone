add the gem (try to maintain the alphabetic order of gems)

  gem 'devise'

then install the gem

  in root of the project run
    bundle

run the devise generator

  bundle exec rails generate devise:install

  this creates config files for devise
    config/initializers/devise.rb # config file for many options you can set in devise (email configs for sender, notifications, etc)
    config/locales/devise.en.yml # translations for messages to show related to sign in, password recovery, etc


setup the initial model

  generate our first user model
    bundle exec rails g devise user
      # this will create a devise model (which handles passwords, encryption, email confirmations, session management, account lockout)

    this creates files

      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20230206020419_devise_create_users.rb # migration that creates user table with all user related fields (password recover, confirm email, lock account)
      create    app/models/user.rb
      invoke    rspec
      create      spec/models/user_spec.rb
      invoke      factory_bot
      create        spec/factories/users.rb
      insert    app/models/user.rb
      route  devise_for :users

run the migration created for the user

  bundle exec rails db:migrate db:test:prepare



with devise installed these are some helper methods you can use

  current_user (you can access this in controllers)
    if the user is not signed in the current_user will be nil so you can use safe navigator with this
      something like current_user&.username&.blank?


  destroy_user_session_path (route to log out)


if you want to see the routes set up by devise

  rails routes | grep users
