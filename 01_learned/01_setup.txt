rails new rails-react-twitter-clone --api --database=postgresql -T

  -T -> do not created default tests created by rails (later we can add rspec)

  --api -> you can check for this in config/application.rb -> config.api_only = true

in Gemfile make sure you have this line
  gem "rack-cors"

  then run 

    bundle install


config/initializers/cors.rb

  leave it like this

    Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
      allow do
        # where your requests come from
        origins "http://127.0.0.1:5173"

        resource "*",
          headers: :any,
          expose: ["Authorization"],
          methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options, :head]
      end
    end

  when testing in local with a client that runs on port 5173, this will work

    origins "http://127.0.0.1:5173"

  if you do this

    origins "*"

    means everyone can access your api

  when you are finally in prod

    origins 'https://super-cool-domain.com'

  expose: ["Authorization"]

    going to be used by devise-jwt


add this gems

  devise
  devise-jwt
  jsonapi-serializer # this one i'm not sure exactly why yet
