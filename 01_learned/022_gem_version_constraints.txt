we put constraints in the versions to avoid breaking changes

gemfile.lock does this but the version contraints in gems helps if the gemfile.lock was not added

these are the recommendations I found

  for most gems → use ~> x.y.z (pessimistic constraint).
  for major frameworks (rails, devise) → use an exact version 'x.y.z'.
  for libraries that follow semantic versioning (puma, sidekiq) → use ~> x.y.
  for security-sensitive gems (nokogiri, openssl) → use >= x.y.z.
  for low-risk gems (pg, sqlite3) → you might not need a version constraint at all.
