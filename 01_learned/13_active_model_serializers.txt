it's a serialization library

  this is to have easier control for the output of your json responses

  notice that there are other serialization libraries. an example of a more modern one is "jsonapi-serializer"

how to install

  add to gemfile
    gem 'active_model_serializers'

  then
    bundle install

  don't forget to restart the rails server to use the serializer correctly

how to set up

  to create a serializer for a model
    for example a serializer for your Tweet model

      rails generate serializer tweet

things to note

  when a model does not have a related serializer file created then it uses the rails' basic serialization
    meaning it will just serialize all attributes

  why it is better to use belongs_to inside serializer files instead of attributes
    you could do something like this

      class TweetSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
        attributes :id, :body, :user
      end

    instead of this

      class TweetSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
        attributes :id, :body

        belongs_to :user
      end

    the first one would work because you will infer the attribute 'user' based on the related model

    but that way you won't be able to customize the output of user
      if you want to customize you will need to use the belongs_to way
