WARNING

  when using this tool you always have to make sure to review what changed if the signature changed
    (maybe that's why i haven't seen this tool being used in project teams because someone might forget)

  https://github.com/sds/overcommit?tab=readme-ov-file#security

setup overcommit for git hooks

  add the gem in Gemfile
    group :development do
      gem 'overcommit'
    end

  run command to install the gem
    bundle install

  run command to install overcommit in the project

    bundle exec overcommit --install

      this creates a .overcommit.yml file

  and example to run rubocop on pre commits with overcommit

    in the .overcommit.yml file put this

      PreCommit:
        RuboCop:
          enabled: true
          problem_on_unmodified_line: report # warn about unmodified lines from files in commit
          on_warn: fail # treat all warnings as failures
          command: ["bundle", "exec", "rubocop", "--auto-correct", "--force-exclusion"] # force-exclusion to make sure no matter what it will respect .rubocop.yml

other things i noticed

  it might be using global versions of gems intalled when running the hooks

    once i tried to do a commit with this i got this warning

      Ignoring debug-1.7.1 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine debug --version 1.7.1

      but i had debug 1.9.1 in my project and 1.7.1 was installed globaly
